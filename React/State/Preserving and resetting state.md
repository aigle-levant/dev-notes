- **What happens to a component's state when it's removed?**: It is destroyed.
- **For how long does React preserve a component's state?**: As long as the component is being rendered at a particular position in the render tree [preserving = maintaining].
- **What happens if I render a different component in the same position of a component?**: The original component is destroyed and the state of the entire sub-tree is reset.
- **What should be done if one wants to preserve state between re-renders?**: Structure of the render tree needs to be the same from one render to another.
	- Always declare component function at top, never nest them.
- **What are the 2 ways by which one can reset the state of a component?**
	- Rendering component in different positions.
		- Often implemented as ``{stateVar && <Component/>}``
	- Giving the component an explicit identity using `key` attribute.
		- Often used with `map` function and rendering lists.
		- Implemented as ``{stateVar ? (<Component key={one}/>) : <Component key={two}/>}``
		- Keys only specify position within parent.
- **How to preserve the state of a removed component?**: You lift the state up and hold the [to-be-deleted] state in the parent component.
