At first glance, an user should be able to understand what your page is made for and how to use it. They shouldn't have to think hard [even for a millisecond] about it.
## Things that can make users think
- Unconventional names for elements used by users.
	- Going by X instead of Twitter
- Buttons and links that aren't clickable.
	- Sign up button at a sign up form that does nothing when clicked.

### Examples

This is a self-evident site. It tells you that you can search for definitions of technical terms in it. Also, each button is clearly defined for its purpose.

This is a confusing website. Even if you *do* understand Dutch, you'll still find navigating the website hard.

This is a self-explanatory website. It takes a while for you to understand that this is about Rio de Janeiro's culture.

## Things to remember from an user's perspective
- Where am I?
- Where should I begin?
- Where did they put _____?
- What are the most important things on this page? 
- Why did they call it that? 
- Is that an ad or part of the site?

> Sometimes, sites can be **self-explanatory**. Meaning, they just need a little thought to get it. Only a *little*.
