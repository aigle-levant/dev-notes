- **What is it?**: A well-defined procedure.
- **Input**: Set of values
- **Output**: Another set of values
- **Process**: Converting given input -> desired output
- **How is it a tool?**: We use it to solve well-specified computational problems.
	- **What problems?**: Problems specified by a problem statement
	- **What is specified?**: Input-output relationship required
	- **Instance**: All the inputs required to compute the solution to a particular problem.
	- **Common characteristics found in problems involving algorithms**
		- Have more than one way to solve this, we just find the best one out of them.
		- Have practical applications in daily life.
- **When is it correct?**
	- If it produces the correct output from given input.
	- If it solves the given computational problem.
- **When is it incorrect?**
	- If it doesn't halt at all. [infinite loop]
	- If it halts with a wrong answer. [incorrect I/O or algorithm used]
	- **Halting**: Problem with 2 choices
		- Program goes into infinite loop
		- Program terminates [halts] at one point.
	- **How should halting be used, then?**: With a controllable error rate.
- **What problem can be solved with algorithms?**
	- Finding the shortest possible route to a place [Djikstra's]
	- Finding the cheapest item in a grocery [binary sort]
	- Cryptography [hashing], etc.
- **How to measure algorithm's efficiency?**: Measure using its speed
	- Speed -> How long does it take to solve a problem
- **How does system performance depend on algorithms?**: System performance depends on how efficient algorithms + hardware are.
