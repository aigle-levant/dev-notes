- **Usage**: Organizing, processing, retrieving, storing data.
	- **Why do we use it?**:
		- To utilize data efficiently

## Classification

- **Linear**
	- Elements are arranged sequentially.
	- Static
		- Has fixed memory size
		- Elements can be easily accessed.
	- Dynamic
		- Doesn't have a fixed memory size
		- Size can be randomly updated during runtime.
		- Efficient at what it does.
- **Non-linear**
	- Elements aren't arranged linearly.
	- We can't traverse in a single run.
