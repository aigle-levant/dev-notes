	- People are in a hurry. Why waste their precious time with having to read the webpage?
	- Not everything has to be read.
	- **Keywords**: Task at hand, interests of the person, words like 'free', 'sale', 'sex', 'danger', and their name.
	- **Solution**: Present the info. in a way that it won't waste people's time to read.
- **They don't make the best, most optimal choice. They satisfice.**
	- **Satisficing**: Choosing the first reasonable option for anything.
	- Eg : When lost in a maze, would you rather *try* a path than figuring out the best path and wasting your time?
